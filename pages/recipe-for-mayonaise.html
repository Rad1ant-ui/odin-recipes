        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Delicious and easy to make mayonnaise as your own dip for fries, spread or whatever you want!</p>
        <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong></ul>
        <li>mustard</li>
        <li>2 egg</li>
        <li>vinegar</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <ol><strong>Directions</strong></ol>
        <li>Prepare your food processor. I prefer to use the small bowl attachment that came with our food processor to make mayonnaise.
        </li>
        <li>Add an egg to the bowl of your food processor and process for about 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add mustard, vinegar, and salt then process for another 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the oil, in tiny drops, until about a quarter of the oil has been added. Adding the oil slowly is really important. If you were to dump it all in at once, youâ€™d have mayonnaise soup!</li>
        <li>Taste the mayonnaise and adjust with additional salt and vinegar or lemon juice.</li>
